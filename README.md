**What is this?**
This is a redie script. It allows for dead people to jump/walk around the map as live players do. It has 0 (or near 0) interaction with live people, meaning they won&#039;t activate auto-traps, make traps stuck, and etc. And unlike alternatives of this script, players are able to collide with **all** entities in the map, so none will fall trough bridges and etc.! Redies also able to use map teleports, so they are able to move to next stages of maps. 

**How does one become a redie?**
By default players must type !redie or !ghost in chat while dead to become redie. You can change these commands by editing config file.

**Will this work with my gamemode?**
Currently Redie script should work with following gamemodes:
- [Mr. Gash Deathrun](https://github.com/Mr-Gash/GMod-Deathrun)
- [Arizard&#039;s Deathrun](https://github.com/Arizard/deathrun)
